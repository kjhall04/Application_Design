What to study:  lecture 1, 1.5, 2

know getters and setters
know print statements
study examples (practice)

    Combining data and functions into a single unit Class 
What is encapsulation?
What is inheritance?

Decorators in classes - the @ property for getting and setting values in classes

super function - allows to inherit or add on to a parent class
    to call a method from the parent class

Application design focuses on functionality but also aesthetics

Modularity - what is Modularity? breaking code down into more managable pieces that can be reused
Reusability - the same code doesn't have to be written repeatedly - code doesn't have to reinvented
        stuff doenst need to be repeatedly

prototyping, wireframing, UML
    wireframing - writing up a visual image of the code

phases of Application design
    protoyping vs wireframing
        prototyping is actual funtional code
        wireframing is just a visual image

primary goal of Application design
    user satisfaction

stages of Application design

seperation of concerns - parts of Application dont depend on eachother too much

UML diagrams, flowcharts, wireframing, prototyping

abstraction and importance
    hides details and complexity

maintainability and scalability 
    good project structure
maintainability - how easy it is to maintain
scalability - allowing the program to grow

ajile methodology

style guide - PEP8

different phases of testing
    unit testing - single parts
    integration testing - multiple parts togther

CICD - continuous integration and continuous deployment

devolpment strategies

diferent types of testing

go over previous coding assignments
    need to point things out or write a couple lines of code
